# universal-transpiler
A universal programming language translator

This is a script that translates programs between several different programming languages.
A demonstration of this translator is shown [here](https://rawgit.com/jarble/transpiler-generator/master/pegjs_test.html).

The original version of this translator is written in JavaScript, but [a new version is being written in Prolog](something.pl).
