# transpiler-generator
A universal programming language translator generator

This is a script that translates programs between several different programming languages.
A demonstration of this translator is shown [here](https://rawgit.com/jarble/transpiler-generator/master/pegjs_test.html).

This repository also includes [a translator that is written in Prolog](something.pl).
